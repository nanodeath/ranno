== ranno

Ranno is a way to annotate your project, to provide useful "compile"-time
and runtime behavior.  Examples of this behavior will eventually be made and
put into the specs, as will documentation.  For now, you have to either look
at the specs or read the small amount of code there is.  Or ask me.
